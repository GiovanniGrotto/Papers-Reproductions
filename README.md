# 🧪 Paper Reproductions

A collection of minimal, readable reimplementations of key machine learning and AI research papers. The goal is to understand and verify core ideas with the simplest possible code — focusing on clarity over performance or full replication.

## 🎯 Purpose

- 📖 Learn deeply by reimplementing from scratch
- 🔬 Reproduce main results or behaviors
- 🧹 Strip away complexity to focus on fundamentals
- 📄 Document insights, issues, and simplifications
